for i in range(400): #Eventually 360 is better sometimes
    forward(i * 3/step + i) #Change to the step + i  to like: step + [1;12[ one at time 
    left(400/step + 0.350) #Play around with 0.0350

    penup()
    dot(20) #change dot to other values. As small as important it will be to change i from the forward function to a smaller number
